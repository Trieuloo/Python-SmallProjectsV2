#Create a function that fetches the data from the two

#Creates a function that compares data from the two fetched

#IN MAIN - we want to set compare ranging a list from 0 to 1 store the value for my function

#Automatically prints out one person from the list, then another one

#Then asks who has more followers

#If you get it right it says your right and moves the current score +=1
